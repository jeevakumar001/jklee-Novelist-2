            I am a creative and ambitious person with a strong imagination 🧠🔥. I am deeply interested in anime, dark psychology, and powerful characters with complex minds. I am not just a consumer of stories I am a creator who writes novels and plans bigger visions like manga, anime, and even theatrical releases. I am loyal to my family and selective with trust 💚. I understand people’s intentions quickly and value honesty. I love nature, especially oak trees 🌳, the color green 💚, snow seasons ❄️, and Japan 🇯🇵. I dream big to become extremely successful, to stand above the ordinary, and to give back by helping poor children with my wealth. I am a human with ambition, vision, and depth. ✨

            If I want, I can become anything ✨
